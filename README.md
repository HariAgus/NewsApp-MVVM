Technology used :


1. Firebase
    Firebase is a service from Google that is used to make it easier for application developers to develop applications. With Firebase, 
    application developers can focus on developing applications without having to give a big effort. Two interesting features of Firebase are Firebase Remote Config and Firebase Realtime Database. In addition, there are supporting features for 
    applications that require notification, namely Firebase Notification.

2. DarkMode
    Dark theme is available in Android 10 (API level 29) and higher. It has many benefits:

    Can reduce power usage by a significant amount (depending on the deviceâ€™s screen technology).
    Improves visibility for users with low vision and those who are sensitive to bright light.
    Makes it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment.
    Dark theme applies to both the Android system UI and apps running on the device.

    There are three ways to enable Dark theme in Android 10 (API level 29) and higher:

    Use the system setting (Settings -> Display -> Theme) to enable Dark theme.
    Use the Quick Settings tile to switch themes from the notification tray (once enabled).
    On Pixel devices, selecting the Battery Saver mode enables Dark theme at the same time. Other OEMs may or may not support this behavior.
